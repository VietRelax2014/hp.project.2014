1
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:06,508
Long before the birth of light

2
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:09,217
there was darkness,

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,958
and from that darkness
came the Dark Elves.

4
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:18,708
Millennia ago the most ruthless
of their kind, Malekith,

5
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:21,125
sought to transform our universe

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,958
back into one of eternal night.

7
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:28,015
Such evil was possible through
the power of the Aether,

8
00:00:29,223 --> 00:00:32,140
an ancient force of infinite destruction.

9
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:39,098
Malekith, the Asgardians attack.

10
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:50,931
The noble of armies of Asgard,
led by my father, King Bor,

11
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:54,681
waged a mighty war
against these creatures.

12
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:07,681
Bring in the Kursed.

13
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:27,140
As the nine worlds
converged above him

14
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:30,931
Malekith could at last
unleash the Aether.

15
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,754
But Asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp.

16
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,223
Without it the Dark Elves fell.

17
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:16,223
With the battle all but lost
Malekith sacrificed his own people

18
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:20,890
in desperate attempt to
lay waste to Asgard's army.

19
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,598
Through their sacrifice we will survive.

20
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:29,065
It will not be in vain.

21
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,773
Malekith was vanquished

22
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:41,348
and the Aether was no more.

23
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:45,315
Or so we were led to believe...

24
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:49,681
Sire, the Aether,
shall we destroy it?

25
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,515
If only we could, but
its power is too great.

26
00:02:55,681 --> 00:03:00,515
Bury it deep. Somewhere
no one will ever find it.

27
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:17,556
THOR: THE DARK WORLD

28
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:25,473
Subtitles by Bambula

29
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,765
Loki.
- Hello, mother.

30
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:47,930
Have I made you proud?

31
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:49,890
Please, don't make this worse.

32
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:52,723
Define worse.
- Enough!

33
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,815
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

34
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:12,598
I really don't see what
all the fuss is about.

35
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,223
Do you not truly feel the
gravity of your crimes?

36
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,556
Wherever you go there
is war, ruin and death.

37
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:25,026
I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent God,

38
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:28,356
just like you.

39
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:33,098
We are not Gods. We are born, we
live, we die, just as humans do.

40
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,223
Give or take five thousand years.

41
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,515
All this because
Loki desires a throne.

42
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,430
It's my birthright!

43
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:48,015
Your birthright was
to die... as a child!

44
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,973
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

45
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:58,765
If I had not taken you in you
would not be here now to hate me.

46
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:03,265
If I am for the axe then for
mercy's sake just... swing it!

47
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:07,015
It's not that I don't love
our little talks, it's just...

48
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:11,398
I don't love them.

49
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:14,931
Frigga is the only reason you are still
alive and you will never see her again.

50
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:18,973
You'll spend the rest of
your days in the dungeon.

51
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:24,981
And what of Thor?

52
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:29,223
You'll make that witless oaf
king while I rot in chains?

53
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:32,640
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done,

54
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,231
he will bring order to
the Nine Realms and then,

55
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:38,890
yes, he will be king.

56
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:46,015
VANAHEIM

57
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,065
I've got this
completely under control!

58
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:31,065
Is that why everything is on fire?

59
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:56,856
You're welcome!

60
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:20,523
All yours.

61
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:26,680
Kronan! Kronan! Kronan!

62
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:43,981
Hello.

63
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,190
I accept your surrender.

64
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,223
Anyone else?

65
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:12,140
Perhaps next time we should
start with the big one.

66
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:37,173
Where do we go next? - Hogun, the peace
is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

67
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:41,265
You should stay here and be with
your people where your heart is.

68
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,100
Asgard can wait.

69
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:47,723
You have my thanks.
- As you have mine.

70
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,190
Heimdall, when you're ready.

71
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:12,056
ASGARD

72
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:43,063
Is Vanaheim secure?
- As Nornheim and Ria,

73
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:46,426
though our work would have gone
more quickly with you in form.

74
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:48,598
You must think I'm a piece of bread

75
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:50,815
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

76
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:53,273
That was not my intent.

77
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:57,683
The first time since Bifrost was destroyed,
the Nine Realms are in peace.

78
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,940
They're well reminded of our strength,

79
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:04,690
and you have earned their
respect and my gratitude.

80
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:07,222
Thank you.

81
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:11,848
Nothing out of order except your
confused and distracted heart.

82
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:14,273
This isn't about Jane Foster, father.

83
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,481
Human lives are fleeting, they're nothing.

84
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:19,015
You'd be better served by
what lies in front of you.

85
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:24,896
I'm telling you this not as the
All-Father, but as your father.

86
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:27,771
You are ready, the time has
come for you to take the throne.

87
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:31,271
Embrace it, celebrate what you
have won. Join your warriors.

88
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:34,187
Eat and drink, revel
in their celebration.

89
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:37,312
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

90
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:24,112
Another!

91
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:42,104
There was a time you
would celebrate for weeks.

92
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,729
I remember you celebrated
the battle of Haragon

93
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:49,771
so much that you
nearly started a second.

94
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:52,612
Well, the first was so much fun.

95
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:00,862
Take a drink with me.

96
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:03,771
Surely the All-Father could have
no further task for you tonight.

97
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:06,029
No, this is one I set myself.

98
00:12:08,271 --> 00:12:10,854
It does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night.

99
00:12:11,854 --> 00:12:13,654
There are Nine Realms.

100
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:16,687
Future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.

101
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:25,562
I thank you for your sword and
for your counsel, good Lady Sif.

102
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:36,021
LONDON

103
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:49,646
Hi.
- Hi.

104
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:52,770
So, what's the story with you?

105
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,436
Why does there have to be a story,
there's no story.

106
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:58,271
You've spent the first ten minutes
of our date hiding behind a menu

107
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:01,671
that has three choices on it. It's
either chicken, vegetarian or fish, Jane.

108
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:05,021
I think there's a story
and I'm thinking the story

109
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:07,407
involves a guy?

110
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,728
It's complicated.

111
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:12,812
Is he still around?
- No, he...

112
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:15,729
went away.
- I've been there.

113
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,937
The going away, it's hard.

114
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:21,891
I'd been seeing a woman and
uh... she took a job in New York.

115
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,354
Eventually the distance killed it.
And... and the fact that she uh...

116
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,757
she kept sleeping with other dudes.

117
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:29,571
No.
- Oh, so many.

118
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:33,271
Hi. Could we get some wine please?

119
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,937
Sure, I'd love some.
- Richard, this is Darcy.

120
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:39,446
What are you doing here?

121
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:42,779
Hello.
- Sup?

122
00:13:43,187 --> 00:13:46,104
So, I show up to work at the
lab-slash-your mom's house,

123
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,562
fully expecting you
to be moping around

124
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:53,202
in your pajamas eating ice cream
obsessing about you know who...

125
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,670
But you're not! You're
wearing lady clothes,

126
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,741
you even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.

127
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:01,229
Is there a point to all this, cause there
really has to be a point to all this.

128
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:05,602
Right. You know that scientific
equipment you don't look at anymore?

129
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:08,270
You might wanna start
looking at it again.

130
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:10,825
This is the reason we
came all the way out here.

131
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,951
It's malfunctioning.
- That's what I said.

132
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:17,111
That's what I did! But you just

133
00:14:17,151 --> 00:14:20,271
did it a little more scientific.
- I'm sure it's nothing. - Yeah.

134
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:21,910
It doesn't look like nothing.

135
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:24,231
It kind-a looks like the
readings Erik was rumbling about.

136
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:27,031
Our friend Eric, kind
of went... banana balls.

137
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:31,471
He is not interested. - I am interested.
- I am not interested. Time to go now.

138
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,871
Okay.

139
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,911
Short but sweet.
- She needs help.

140
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:47,151
I think I'm gonna have sea-bass.
- Sea bass. Yeah, sea bass is good.

141
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:51,551
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea
bass, sea bass, sea bass... sea bass.

142
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:57,311
Sea bass...

143
00:14:57,751 --> 00:15:01,431
Jane, maybe you should stop saying
sea bass and go out to your friend.

144
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:03,910
This was so fun.

145
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:06,311
You know, I'll just stay
here and say sea bass alone.

146
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,608
And I hate you.
- What? I said he was cute.

147
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,071
Just shut up and drive.

148
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,511
Here it says the next left.

149
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,991
Who is he?
- He's my intern.

150
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:36,351
You have an intern?
- Yeah.

151
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:39,831
Hello, Dr. Foster. It's uh... it's
a great honor to be working with you.

152
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,866
Right. I have to call Erik.

153
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:44,505
Oh, uh... take a right.

154
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,372
Left.

155
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,751
I have totally mastered driving in London.

156
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:55,671
Hi, Erik, it's me, again. Where are you?

157
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:59,391
I came here because you said you
were onto something and then vanished.

158
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:01,070
I'm here at Stonehenge,

159
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:03,831
for what has been an interesting
unfolding of events today.

160
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:07,311
The police were called to the scene
shortly after 11 a. m. this morning,

161
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:10,671
after a seemingly harmless
rambler approached the area,

162
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:13,511
then decided to strip naked and
effectively

163
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:16,151
terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment

164
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,431
while shouting that he
was trying to save them.

165
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:23,071
The man later identified as noted
Astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig

166
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:25,111
has been called in for
questioning by police.

167
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:29,951
Come on! This is exciting!

168
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:33,031
Look! The intern is exciting!
- Ian.

169
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:35,265
Do you want the phase meter?
- No.

170
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,071
Bring the phase meter.

171
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:39,991
The toaster looking thing.
- I know what the phase meter is.

172
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:51,111
How do I change the
ring tone on this thing?

173
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:54,711
An Astrophysicist with three degrees
should be able to change her own ring tone.

174
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:58,671
Why are you calling me? - I didn't want to
shout. Intern, the entrance is this way.

175
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:00,871
Ian. My name is Ian.

176
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:18,071
I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.

177
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,510
It's okay! We're Americans!

178
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:22,311
Is that supposed to
make them like us?

179
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:24,146
Make it go away...
- Shhh...

180
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:27,751
Oh, they're kids.

181
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,751
Are you the police?

182
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:32,631
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

183
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:35,871
Thanks.
- We just found it.

184
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,991
Can you show us?

185
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,551
That doesn't seem right.

186
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:27,031
Where did it go?

187
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:42,191
That's... that's incredible.

188
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:57,910
What happened?

189
00:18:57,911 --> 00:18:59,951
Sometimes they come back,
sometimes they don't.

190
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:05,405
I want to throw something.

191
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:07,206
Jane, give me your shoe.

192
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:11,911
I haven't seen readings like this since...

193
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,391
New Mexico?

194
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,191
Don't touch anything!

195
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,711
Give me your shoe.

196
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:47,151
Were those the car keys?

197
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:27,511
Darcy!

198
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,212
The Aether awakens us.

199
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:32,252
The Convergence returns.

200
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,950
You're late.

201
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,710
Merriment can sometimes be
a heavier burden than battle.

202
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,390
Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.

203
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,990
Perhaps.

204
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,630
How fare the stars?
- Still shining.

205
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,190
From here I can see Nine
Realms and ten trillion souls.

206
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,790
You recall what I told
you of the Convergence?

207
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,625
Yes, the alignment of the worlds.

208
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,790
It approaches, doesn't it?

209
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,467
The universe hasn't seen this
marvel since before my watch began.

210
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,190
Few can sense it,
even fewer can see it.

211
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,670
A world that's infected
can be dangerous.

212
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,910
It is truly beautiful.

213
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,710
I see nothing.

214
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,630
Or perhaps that is not
the beauty you seek.

215
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:49,755
How is she?
- She's quite clever, your mortal.

216
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,230
She doesn't know it yet, but she
studies the Convergence as well.

217
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,510
Even...
- What?

218
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,470
I can't see her.

219
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,830
Jane! Where the hell were you?

220
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,795
Tell me you didn't call the police!
- What was I supposed to do?

221
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,310
Not call the police! - I was freaking out.
- You call the cops they call the feds,

222
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,550
the next thing you know we have SHIELD
crawling all over area 51 in the place.

223
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,710
Jane. - We had a stable gravitational
anomaly, we had unheeded access.

224
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,030
Our only competition
was ten years old!

225
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,550
Jane, you were gone for five hours!

226
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,030
What?

227
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,230
That's weird.

228
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,190
Typical.

229
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,510
Jane.

230
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,910
Sorry. I just needed to
make sure you were real,

231
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:47,630
it's been a very strange day.
- Well, I am. Jane...

232
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,270
Where were you?!
- Where were you?

233
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,030
Heimdall could not see you.
- I was right here where you left me.

234
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,630
I was waiting and then I was crying
and then I went out looking for you.

235
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,510
You said you were coming back. - I know,
I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed.

236
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,110
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.

237
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,110
Wars were raging,
Marauders were pillaging.

238
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,430
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

239
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,230
As excuses go, that's not terrible.

240
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,630
But I saw you on TV, you
were... you were in New York!

241
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,190
Jane, I fought to protect you from
the dangers of my world, but...

242
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:24,190
I was wrong, I was a fool.

243
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,590
I believe that fate
brought us together.

244
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,550
Jane, I don't know where you were
or what happened, but I do know this.

245
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,510
What?

246
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,550
I know...
- You do?

247
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,830
Do what?
- What?

248
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,430
Hey!

249
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,750
Is that you?

250
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:58,590
We're kinda of the middle of something.
- I am pretty sure we're getting arrested.

251
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,110
Hold that thought.

252
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,870
Look at you! Still all
muscly and everything.

253
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,630
How's space?
- Space is fine.

254
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,110
Excuse me?
- Are you Jane Foster? - Yes.

255
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,070
Do you know this man?

256
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,810
He's my intern.
My intern's intern.

257
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,830
This is private property
and you're trespassing,

258
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,670
the lot of you.
You'll have to come with me.

259
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:31,030
Jane. Jane?
- Thor...

260
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,750
You alright?
- What just happened?

261
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,710
Place your hands on your head,
step back!

262
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,977
The woman is unwell.
- She's dangerous.

263
00:27:40,012 --> 00:27:41,812
So am I.

264
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,859
Requesting armed response
officers to the scene.

265
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,919
Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?

266
00:27:55,095 --> 00:27:56,935
Holy shit!

267
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:26,255
We have to do that again.

268
00:28:27,215 --> 00:28:29,095
Hi.

269
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:32,455
Welcome to Asgard.

270
00:28:37,655 --> 00:28:42,655
SVARTALHEIM

271
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:57,015
Look my legacy, Algrim.

272
00:28:58,615 --> 00:29:01,215
I barely remember
the time before light.

273
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:04,815
Our survival will be your legacy.

274
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:10,180
Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

275
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,104
I'll reclaim the Aether.

276
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:15,952
I'll restore our world and I'll
put an end to this poisonous world.

277
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,663
What's that?
- Be still.

278
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:36,303
This is not of Earth.
What is it?

279
00:29:37,463 --> 00:29:43,223
We do not know. But she will not survive
the amount of energy surging within her.

280
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:51,263
That's a quantum field
generator, isn't it?

281
00:29:51,663 --> 00:29:53,463
It's a Soul Forge.

282
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:55,308
Does a Soul Forge transfer

283
00:29:55,343 --> 00:29:57,943
molecular energy from one
place to another?

284
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:02,463
Yes.
- It's a quantum field generator.

285
00:30:04,023 --> 00:30:06,983
My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?

286
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:09,423
She's ill.
- She is mortal.

287
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:12,063
Illness is their defining trait.

288
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:15,543
I brought here because we can help her.
- She does not belong here in Asgard

289
00:30:15,623 --> 00:30:18,903
anymore than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.

290
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:21,142
Did he just...

291
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:24,943
Who do you think you are?
- I'm Odin. King of Asgard.

292
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:27,383
Protector of the Nine Realms.

293
00:30:27,903 --> 00:30:32,143
Oh. Well, I'm...
- I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.

294
00:30:33,823 --> 00:30:35,623
You told your father about me?

295
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:38,788
Something is within her, father.
Something I have not seen before...

296
00:30:38,823 --> 00:30:42,343
Her world has its healers, they're
called doctors. Let them deal with it.

297
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:44,263
Guards, take her back to Midgard.

298
00:30:45,663 --> 00:30:47,463
No! I would not...

299
00:30:49,143 --> 00:30:52,623
...touch her.
Jane, are you alright?

300
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:58,398
That's impossible.

301
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,798
The infection, it's defending her.

302
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:06,118
No, it's defending itself.

303
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:08,678
Come with me.

304
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,198
There are relics that
predate the universe itself.

305
00:31:12,878 --> 00:31:16,278
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.

306
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:19,998
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

307
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:22,678
They had a dawn as they will have a dusk.

308
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:27,438
But before that dawn the
dark forces, the Dark Elves,

309
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:31,398
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

310
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:37,598
Born of eternal night, the Dark
Elves come to steal away the light.

311
00:31:37,838 --> 00:31:40,918
There were these stories
mother told to us as children.

312
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:44,798
Their leader, Malekith made
a weapon out of that darkness,

313
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,637
it was called the Aether.

314
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,318
While the other relics
often appear as stones,

315
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:54,678
the Aether is fluid and ever changing.
It changes matter into dark matter

316
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,398
and seeks out to host bodies, drawing
strength from their life force.

317
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:03,302
Malekith sought to
use the Aether's power

318
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:06,886
to return the universe
to one of darkness.

319
00:32:08,057 --> 00:32:10,857
But after eternities of bloodshed,

320
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:13,657
my father Bor, finally triumphed,

321
00:32:13,937 --> 00:32:17,977
ushering in the peace that
lasted thousands of years.

322
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,537
What happened?

323
00:32:22,177 --> 00:32:23,977
He killed them all.

324
00:32:24,217 --> 00:32:26,017
Are you certain?

325
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:29,697
The Aether was said to have been
destroyed with them and yet here it is.

326
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:33,097
The Dark Elves are dead.

327
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:36,817
Does your book happen to
mention how to get it out of me?

328
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:40,497
No, it does not.

329
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:54,525
The Realms will be aligned soon.

330
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:03,915
You'll be the last of the Kursed.
- Let my life be sacrificed.

331
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:08,799
The same thing did our people.

332
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:21,285
You will become darkness,
doomed to this existence

333
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:24,405
until it consumes you.

334
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:32,925
And then no power of our
enemies won't stop me.

335
00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:42,044
I'll destroy their defense
and resurrect the universe.

336
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,268
Odin continues to
bring me new friends.

337
00:34:34,548 --> 00:34:36,227
How thoughtful.

338
00:34:36,228 --> 00:34:39,068
The books I sent,
do they not interest you?

339
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:43,428
Is that how I'm to while
away eternity, reading?

340
00:34:43,468 --> 00:34:48,148
I've done everything in my power to
make you comfortable, Loki. - Have you?

341
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:51,468
Does Odin share your concern?

342
00:34:52,388 --> 00:34:54,188
Does Thor?

343
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:57,868
It must be so inconvenient them
asking after me day and night.

344
00:34:58,148 --> 00:35:01,268
You know full well that your
actions have brought you here.

345
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:03,227
My actions?

346
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:06,508
I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I've been fed my entire life,

347
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:08,468
that I was born to be a king.
- A king?

348
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,868
A true king admits his faults.

349
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:13,743
What of the lives you took on Earth?

350
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:16,503
A mere handful compared to
the numbers Odin has taken himself.

351
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:20,103
Your father...
- He's not my father!

352
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:25,053
Then am I not your mother?

353
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,053
You're not.

354
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:40,733
Always so perceptive about
everyone but yourself.

355
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,253
When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.

356
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:02,493
Well, Heimdall had lost sight of
you, you were no longer on Earth.

357
00:36:02,853 --> 00:36:06,253
Well, how's that possible?
- I believe you are and you weren't.

358
00:36:06,293 --> 00:36:10,493
The Nine Realms travel within
Yggdrasil, orbiting Midgard

359
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,533
in much the way your
planet orbits the sun.

360
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:16,453
Every five thousand years
the worlds align perfectly.

361
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:18,613
We call this the Convergence.

362
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:24,133
During this time the borders
between worlds become blurred.

363
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:28,093
It's possible you found
one of these points.

364
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,333
We are lucky that it remained open.

365
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:36,253
Once the worlds pass out of
alignment,

366
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:40,653
the connection is lost.

367
00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:55,773
I like the way you explain things.

368
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:01,053
What's gonna happen to me?
- I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

369
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,573
Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.

370
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:06,933
Don't let him hear you say that.

371
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:12,493
Jane Foster, please meet Frigga,
the Queen of Asgard, my mother.

372
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:16,253
Hi.

373
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:22,293
You might want to take
the stairs to the left.

374
00:39:33,386 --> 00:39:37,994
The prisons. - Loki.
- Go, I will look after her.

375
00:39:50,427 --> 00:39:52,547
It's as if they resent
being imprisoned.

376
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:58,067
There is no pleasing some creatures.

377
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:10,867
Return to your cells and no further
harm will come to you. You have my word.

378
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:15,153
Very well, you don't have my word.

379
00:40:24,393 --> 00:40:28,073
Send a squadron to the weapons
vault, defend it at all costs.

380
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:30,193
Secure the dungeon.
- Odin.

381
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:32,673
Frigga. Go!

382
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:36,025
It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.

383
00:40:36,145 --> 00:40:38,065
You've never been a very good liar.

384
00:40:38,465 --> 00:40:42,905
Take her to you chambers, I'll come
for you when it's safe. - You take care.

385
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,665
Despite all I have survived,
my queen still worries over me.

386
00:40:48,185 --> 00:40:51,305
It's only because I worry over
you that you have survived.

387
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:54,984
Listen to me now.

388
00:40:54,985 --> 00:41:00,025
I need you to do everything I
ask and no questions. - Yes, ma'am.

389
00:46:27,465 --> 00:46:29,265
Frigga.

390
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:38,945
Stand down, creature.

391
00:46:39,905 --> 00:46:43,585
You may still survive this.
- I have survived worse, woman.

392
00:46:45,025 --> 00:46:48,305
Who are you?
- I am Malekith,

393
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:51,345
and I would have what it is mine.

394
00:47:22,225 --> 00:47:24,905
You have taken something, child.

395
00:47:25,785 --> 00:47:27,625
Give it back.

396
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:43,065
Witch!

397
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:49,265
Where is the Aether?
- I'll never tell you.

398
00:47:50,385 --> 00:47:52,185
I believe you.

399
00:51:22,585 --> 00:51:25,745
The universe rotates on a
five thousand year cycle,

400
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,485
and once its cycled all the worlds align.

401
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:32,769
Imagine... imagine that this
is our world, and... and...

402
00:51:32,804 --> 00:51:36,100
Thank you. And this is another
world. Normally they're separate,

403
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,623
but during the alignment
everything is connected.

404
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:44,263
All Nine Realms, all Nine Realms
are passing through each other.

405
00:51:44,303 --> 00:51:48,863
And gravity, light, and even matter,
is crushing from one world to the other.

406
00:51:51,383 --> 00:51:54,703
But if this happens to us now,
the result would be cataclysmic.

407
00:51:55,303 --> 00:51:58,023
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize

408
00:51:58,143 --> 00:52:00,183
the focal point of the Convergence.

409
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:02,783
This time the alignment,

410
00:52:02,983 --> 00:52:06,307
and all the other worlds,
would just pass us by.

411
00:52:07,008 --> 00:52:08,808
It's beautiful.

412
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:11,823
It's simple. Any questions?

413
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:18,336
Yeah. Can I have my shoe back?

414
00:52:26,463 --> 00:52:30,183
I need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.

415
00:52:31,823 --> 00:52:35,463
And when you wake up,
you will kill them all.

416
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:12,383
Jane Foster.

417
00:53:13,862 --> 00:53:15,702
You need to come with us.

418
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:20,220
We are still unable to
restore the palace shields.

419
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,500
Our artillery cannot detect them,

420
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:24,700
even Heimdall cannot see them.

421
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,700
My King, we are all but defenseless.

422
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,500
She's your prisoner now?

423
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,100
Leave us.

424
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,620
I do not wish to fight with you.

425
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,220
Nor I with you,

426
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,220
but I intend to pursue Malekith.
- We possess the Aether,

427
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,340
Malekith will come to us.
- Yes, and you will destroy us.

428
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,700
You overestimate the
power of these creatures.

429
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,220
No, I value our people's lives.

430
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,200
I'll take Jane to the Dark World

431
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:08,060
and draw the enemy away from Asgard.

432
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,540
When Malekith pulls
the Aether from Jane,

433
00:54:10,575 --> 00:54:12,700
it will be exposed vulnerable,

434
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,340
and I will destroy it and him.

435
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,380
If you fail,

436
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:21,020
you risk this weapon falling
into the hands of our enemies.

437
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,700
The risk is far greater
if we do nothing.

438
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,180
His ship could be over our heads
right now and we'd never even know it.

439
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:32,460
If and when he comes, his men will
fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades.

440
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,580
And how of our men shall fall on theirs?
- As many as are needed!

441
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,220
We will fight!

442
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,780
Until the last Asgardian breath,

443
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,420
the last drop of Asgardian blood.

444
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:01,540
And how are you
different from Malekith?

445
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,500
The difference,
my son, is that I will win.

446
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,740
Jane isn't called me back.
Erik isn't calling me back.

447
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,820
Stupid SHIELD isn't calling me back!

448
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,660
What is SHIELD?
- It's a secret.

449
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,622
Hey, Erik. It's Darcy again.
Thor came back.

450
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:33,429
He took Jane to Asgard.

451
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:37,020
And um... I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

452
00:55:37,055 --> 00:55:40,982
Something else went missing this week
when Astrophysicist, Dr. Erik Selvig,

453
00:55:41,062 --> 00:55:44,987
notable for his involvement in
the Alien invasion of New York

454
00:55:45,022 --> 00:55:49,075
streaked nude across Stonehenge.
- Darcy, you really need to look at this.

455
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:52,524
Your friend Erik, what
was his last name again?

456
00:55:52,935 --> 00:55:56,956
...disrobed and began shouting at
visitors at the historic site.

457
00:55:57,568 --> 00:56:01,939
He was later taken into police
custody for psychiatric evaluation.

458
00:56:02,553 --> 00:56:05,333
The police are still
refusing to confirm...

459
00:56:15,276 --> 00:56:17,236
You're not in Odin's war council?

460
00:56:17,436 --> 00:56:20,236
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

461
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,636
No one is to come or to go.

462
00:56:24,636 --> 00:56:27,756
We face an enemy that
is invisible even to me.

463
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:31,236
Of what use is a guardian such as that?

464
00:56:32,236 --> 00:56:34,956
Malekith will return, you know this.

465
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:39,635
I'll need your help.

466
00:56:39,636 --> 00:56:41,796
I cannot overrule my King's wishes,

467
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:45,076
not even for you.
- I'm not asking you to.

468
00:56:45,116 --> 00:56:48,356
The Realms need the All-Father strong
and unchallenged,

469
00:56:48,396 --> 00:56:50,155
whether he is or not.

470
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,356
But he is blinded, Heimdall,

471
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:55,156
by hatred and by grief.
- As are we all.

472
00:56:55,196 --> 00:56:56,996
I see clearly enough.

473
00:56:57,196 --> 00:56:59,041
The risks are too great.

474
00:56:59,076 --> 00:57:01,476
Everything that we do from here on
is a risk,

475
00:57:01,596 --> 00:57:03,396
there is no other way.

476
00:57:07,596 --> 00:57:09,396
What do you require of me?

477
00:57:10,116 --> 00:57:12,876
What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.

478
00:57:13,716 --> 00:57:17,916
Success will bring us exile and
failure shall mean our death.

479
00:57:20,476 --> 00:57:23,036
Malekith knew the Aether was here.

480
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:24,876
He can sense its power.

481
00:57:25,076 --> 00:57:27,396
If we do nothing he
will come for it again,

482
00:57:27,436 --> 00:57:31,316
but this time lay
waste to all of Asgard.

483
00:57:32,636 --> 00:57:34,436
We must move Jane off world.

484
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:38,156
The Bifrost has been shut down and
the Tesseract locked away in a vault.

485
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:40,596
There are other paths off Asgard,

486
00:57:41,076 --> 00:57:44,316
ways known only to a few.
- One, actually.

487
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,596
No.

488
00:57:52,796 --> 00:57:54,596
Thor.

489
00:57:54,716 --> 00:57:57,836
After all this time now
you come to visit me.

490
00:58:00,036 --> 00:58:01,836
Why?

491
00:58:02,756 --> 00:58:04,556
Have you come to gloat?

492
00:58:05,156 --> 00:58:07,276
To mock?
- Loki, enough.

493
00:58:07,836 --> 00:58:09,676
No more illusions.

494
00:58:16,876 --> 00:58:18,676
Now you see me, brother.

495
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:28,955
Did she suffer?

496
00:58:28,956 --> 00:58:31,436
I did not come here to share our grief.

497
00:58:32,017 --> 00:58:34,897
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

498
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:40,329
Go on. - I know you seek
vengeance as much as I do.

499
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:45,049
You help me escape Asgard and I
will grant it to you, vengeance.

500
00:58:45,409 --> 00:58:47,409
And afterwards, this cell.

501
00:58:54,089 --> 00:58:57,129
You must be truly desperate

502
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:59,249
to come to me for help.

503
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:04,289
What makes you think you can trust me?
- I don't.

504
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:07,649
Mother did.

505
00:59:07,929 --> 00:59:10,889
You should know that when we
fought each other in the past,

506
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:15,169
I did so with the glimmer of hope that
my brother was still in there somewhere.

507
00:59:16,249 --> 00:59:18,849
That hope no longer
exists to protect you.

508
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:22,049
You betray me and I will kill you.

509
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:30,414
When do we start?

510
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:33,169
He will betray you.
- He will try.

511
00:59:37,929 --> 00:59:39,849
This is so unlike you, brother.

512
00:59:40,529 --> 00:59:42,369
So clandestine.

513
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:45,409
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

514
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,769
If you keep speaking I just might.

515
00:59:47,929 --> 00:59:51,489
Fine. As you wish. I'm not even here.

516
00:59:52,209 --> 00:59:55,569
Is this better?
- It's better company at least.

517
00:59:56,769 --> 01:00:00,289
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

518
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:05,449
Hm, brother. You look ravishing.

519
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:09,119
It will hurt no less when
I kill you in this form.

520
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:12,289
Very well. Perhaps you prefer
one of your new companions,

521
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:14,569
given that you seem
to like them so much.

522
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:17,129
Oh, this is much better.

523
01:00:18,689 --> 01:00:23,009
Costume's a bit much... so tight.
But the confidence,

524
01:00:23,044 --> 01:00:25,289
I can feel the righteousness surging.

525
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:27,689
Hey, you wanna have a rousing
discussion about truth,

526
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:30,929
honor, patriotism?
God bless America...

527
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:35,169
What?

528
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:41,129
You can at least
furnish me with a weapon.

529
01:00:41,729 --> 01:00:43,529
My dagger, something!

530
01:00:49,009 --> 01:00:52,569
At last, a little common sense.

531
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:00,169
I thought you liked tricks.

532
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:05,769
What then? Your lovely mortal is being
guarded by a legion of our Einherjar

533
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:09,489
who will see you coming from miles away.
- I won't be the one who comes for her.

534
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:18,889
I'm not hungry.

535
01:01:20,369 --> 01:01:22,169
Good, let's go.

536
01:01:28,249 --> 01:01:32,889
You? - I'm Loki. You may have heard
of me. - That was for New York.

537
01:01:33,969 --> 01:01:37,449
I like her.
- And what of the All-Father?

538
01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:39,609
It is my sworn duty to notify him

539
01:01:39,624 --> 01:01:41,424
of crimes against the throne.

540
01:01:41,889 --> 01:01:45,249
You called me here on an urgent matter.

541
01:01:46,289 --> 01:01:50,129
What is it?
- Treason, my lord. - Whose?

542
01:01:51,329 --> 01:01:53,169
Mine.

543
01:01:53,449 --> 01:01:56,769
My King, the mortal has been taken.

544
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:04,009
Stop Thor, by any means necessary.

545
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:09,750
Here they are. Take them.
On my command.

546
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:12,110
I'll hold them off.
Take her.

547
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,830
Thank you.

548
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,310
Betray him and I'll kill you.

549
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:23,230
It's good to see you too, Sif.

550
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:31,750
Assuming you can get Loki's help,

551
01:02:31,785 --> 01:02:33,870
and you can free this mortal,

552
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:36,590
what good would it do? We'd all be dead

553
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,830
the minute we step one
foot outside the palace.

554
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:42,190
That, my friend, is where
we won't be leaving by foot.

555
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,310
I will give you as much time as I can.

556
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:50,150
Thank you, my friend.

557
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:56,550
If you even think about betraying him...

558
01:02:56,830 --> 01:03:00,950
You'll kill me? Evidently
there will be a line.

559
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:18,550
I thought you said you
knew how to fly this thing.

560
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:21,030
I said how hard could it be.

561
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:27,230
They're on the ship!
Get to the ship!

562
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:33,150
Well, whatever you're doing,
brother, I suggest you do it faster.

563
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:34,990
Shut up, Loki.

564
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:40,430
You must have missed something. - I didn't,
I'm pressing every button on this thing.

565
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:43,010
No, don't hit it, just press it gently.

566
01:03:43,045 --> 01:03:45,510
I am pressing it gently. It's not working!

567
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:25,150
I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!

568
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:34,550
Look, why don't you let me take
over, I'm clearly the best pilot.

569
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:38,510
Is that right? Well, out of the two
of us which one can actually fly?

570
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:51,470
Oh, dear. Is she dead?
- Jane?

571
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:54,270
I am okay.

572
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:02,110
Not a word.

573
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:05,550
Now they're following us.

574
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:12,950
Now they're firing at us! - Yeah,
thank you for the commentary, Loki!

575
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,270
It's not at all distracting!

576
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:21,750
Well done, you just
decapitated your grandfather.

577
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,950
You know this is wonderful.
This is a tremendous idea.

578
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,850
Let's steal the biggest and
most obvious ship in the universe

579
01:05:39,885 --> 01:05:41,549
and escape in that,

580
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:45,030
flying around the city, smashing into
everything in sight so everyone can see us.

581
01:05:45,065 --> 01:05:47,830
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!

582
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:03,475
I see your time in the dungeons

583
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:06,030
has made you no less graceful, Loki.

584
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,710
You lied to me.

585
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,470
I'm impressed.
- I'm glad you're pleased.

586
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:18,630
Now, do as you promised.
Take us to your secret pathway.

587
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:44,390
Frandal.
- Right.

588
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:49,190
For Asgard.

589
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:56,030
Nothing personal, boys.

590
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:14,910
Loki.
- If it were easy everyone would do it.

591
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:17,750
Are you mad?
- Possibly.

592
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,790
We must attack now.

593
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:46,150
No.

594
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:52,159
Asgard is not important anymore.

595
01:07:57,223 --> 01:07:59,863
The Aether has returned home.

596
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:19,042
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.

597
01:08:19,082 --> 01:08:24,482
It would consume you.
- She's holding up alright,

598
01:08:24,922 --> 01:08:28,722
for now. - She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.

599
01:08:29,402 --> 01:08:31,682
Say goodbye.
- Not this day.

600
01:08:31,922 --> 01:08:37,921
This day, the next, a hundred
years is nothing. It's a heartbeat.

601
01:08:38,482 --> 01:08:43,242
You'll never be ready.
The only woman whose love you prized

602
01:08:43,362 --> 01:08:45,322
will be snatched from you.
- And will that satisfy you?

603
01:08:45,362 --> 01:08:49,722
Satisfaction is not in my nature.
- Surrender is not in mine.

604
01:08:50,322 --> 01:08:53,242
The son of Odin.
- No, not just of Odin!

605
01:08:53,722 --> 01:08:56,142
You think you alone who loved mother?

606
01:08:56,177 --> 01:08:58,562
You had her tricks, but I had her trust!

607
01:08:58,642 --> 01:09:02,122
Trust. Was that her last expression?

608
01:09:02,802 --> 01:09:06,922
Trust? When you let her die!
- What help were you in your cell?

609
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:11,122
Who put me there? Who put me there?!
- You know damn well!

610
01:09:11,162 --> 01:09:13,282
You know damn well!

611
01:09:19,642 --> 01:09:22,682
She wouldn't want us to fight.

612
01:09:23,522 --> 01:09:25,322
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

613
01:09:30,162 --> 01:09:34,242
I wish I could trust you.

614
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:49,722
Trust my rage.

615
01:09:55,322 --> 01:09:58,722
You'll have to sign for your
father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.

616
01:09:59,322 --> 01:10:05,042
What?
Oh, yeah. My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.

617
01:10:06,722 --> 01:10:11,802
One; a man's leather wallet,
brown. One key ring with three keys.

618
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:15,682
Prescription medicine.
Various.

619
01:10:21,922 --> 01:10:24,562
And... These.
- Yeah, those.

620
01:10:25,082 --> 01:10:27,602
Thank goodness.

621
01:10:28,082 --> 01:10:30,082
Eric.

622
01:10:31,242 --> 01:10:33,602
Yes?
- It's uh... Darcy.

623
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:36,059
Darcy.

624
01:10:37,002 --> 01:10:40,442
It's so good to see you.
- Uh... I missed you too.

625
01:10:40,602 --> 01:10:43,722
How did you find me?
- You were naked on TV.

626
01:10:43,962 --> 01:10:47,442
Okay, time to go. Lots to do.

627
01:10:48,642 --> 01:10:50,442
Getting weird now.

628
01:10:51,682 --> 01:10:54,642
I should not be left in
charge of stuff like this,

629
01:10:54,762 --> 01:10:58,442
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid period.

630
01:10:58,562 --> 01:11:01,642
I'm uh... Ian by the way.
Uh... Darcy's intern.

631
01:11:01,762 --> 01:11:06,242
I don't get paid either.
Are you alright?

632
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:10,442
I have had a God in my
brain. I don't recommend it.

633
01:11:12,482 --> 01:11:14,722
Dr. Selvig, your gear is beeping at me.

634
01:11:14,757 --> 01:11:16,962
It's happening, sooner
than I calculated.

635
01:11:17,322 --> 01:11:19,322
Wait, what's happening?

636
01:11:22,562 --> 01:11:27,282
Birds? Birds are happening?
- Starlings, it's called a murmuration.

637
01:11:27,522 --> 01:11:30,042
My dad used to take me
bird watching as a kid.

638
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:32,282
Eric?
- Look.

639
01:11:36,842 --> 01:11:38,882
Where did they go?

640
01:11:51,522 --> 01:11:56,042
What the hell was that?!
Why are you smiling?

641
01:11:56,322 --> 01:11:57,971
There's nothing more reassuring

642
01:11:57,972 --> 01:12:00,465
than realizing that the
world is crazier than you are.

643
01:12:01,522 --> 01:12:04,522
Take me to Jane's lab!

644
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:18,602
Jane.

645
01:12:24,362 --> 01:12:26,162
Malekith.

646
01:12:47,882 --> 01:12:50,362
Alright, are you ready?
- I am.

647
01:13:04,802 --> 01:13:07,882
You know this plan of yours is going
to get us killed. - Yeah, possibly.

648
01:13:12,282 --> 01:13:17,402
You still don't trust me, brother?
- Would you?

649
01:13:25,522 --> 01:13:28,042
No, I wouldn't.

650
01:13:31,002 --> 01:13:33,522
Thor!

651
01:13:33,882 --> 01:13:35,682
No!

652
01:13:44,322 --> 01:13:47,802
You really think I cared
about Frigga,

653
01:13:47,842 --> 01:13:49,642
about anybody?

654
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:56,882
All I ever wanted was you
and Odin dead at my feet!

655
01:14:09,442 --> 01:14:11,722
Malekith!

656
01:14:11,842 --> 01:14:15,722
I am Loki of Jotunheim
and I bring you a gift!

657
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:19,282
I ask only one thing in return,

658
01:14:20,362 --> 01:14:23,082
a good seat from which
to watch Asgard burn.

659
01:14:24,282 --> 01:14:29,762
He is an enemy of Asgard,
he was locked in a cell.

660
01:14:43,002 --> 01:14:45,522
Look at me.

661
01:15:42,682 --> 01:15:44,482
Loki, now!

662
01:18:58,282 --> 01:19:00,722
No!

663
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:11,042
See you in hell, monster!

664
01:19:30,362 --> 01:19:32,842
No, no, no!

665
01:19:34,477 --> 01:19:37,317
Oh you fool, you didn't listen!
- I know,

666
01:19:38,677 --> 01:19:40,957
I'm a fool. I'm a fool!

667
01:19:41,037 --> 01:19:42,837
Stay with me. Stay!

668
01:19:43,437 --> 01:19:45,477
I'm sorry.

669
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:47,957
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

670
01:19:53,557 --> 01:19:57,237
It's alright. I'll tell
father what you did here today.

671
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:03,917
I didn't do it for him.

672
01:20:12,877 --> 01:20:15,357
No!

673
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:10,449
He's gonna unleash it,

674
01:21:10,929 --> 01:21:15,729
not just on Asgard or on a star,
Malekith is gonna destroy everything.

675
01:21:16,649 --> 01:21:19,169
How? Jane, how?

676
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:24,289
I saw him on Earth. Why would
he go to Earth? - The Convergence.

677
01:21:25,449 --> 01:21:28,769
Oh, God. None of this would have
happened if I hadn't found the Aether.

678
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:32,249
Then Malekith would have only
possessed it that much sooner.

679
01:21:33,049 --> 01:21:36,769
I only found it because
I was looking for you. - Jane...

680
01:21:38,889 --> 01:21:40,969
Now we're trapped here.

681
01:21:47,329 --> 01:21:49,569
It's not me.

682
01:21:49,809 --> 01:21:52,449
Hello?
- Hi, Jane, it's Richard.

683
01:21:52,489 --> 01:21:55,449
Richard?! Where are you?
- I'm still in the office.

684
01:21:55,689 --> 01:21:58,769
It's... It's been a crazy day here today.
- Oh, my God! This is amazing.

685
01:21:58,849 --> 01:22:03,049
Is it? I quite enjoyed our lunch
despite never actually ordering anything.

686
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:06,569
How am I getting service here? - Is this
a bad time? Do you want me to try you later?

687
01:22:06,609 --> 01:22:09,889
No, no, no, no! Please, whatever
you do, do not hang up the phone.

688
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:14,169
Okay then. I was just wondering
if you want to try again?

689
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:17,369
Uh... maybe dinner next time?
- Uh... yeah, yeah, yeah.

690
01:22:17,489 --> 01:22:20,169
Um... just stay on the phone, okay?
- Yeah, I will.

691
01:22:20,449 --> 01:22:22,249
Oh, my God.

692
01:22:26,009 --> 01:22:28,569
Am I interrupting something?
- No, no, no, nothing at all.

693
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:32,329
Come on. - I'm losing you there, are
you in a tunnel? - Wait, where are we going?

694
01:22:33,289 --> 01:22:35,689
Hello?
- Why are there so many shoes in here?

695
01:22:37,689 --> 01:22:39,569
I'll just text her.

696
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:55,550
So who's Richard?
- Really?

697
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:07,710
Jane, you can't just leave like that.
The whole world is going crazy.

698
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:10,830
All the stuff we saw is spreading.

699
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:13,510
Did you go to a party?
- Eric?

700
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:16,510
Jane, how wonderful.

701
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:21,390
You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?

702
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:24,475
He says it helps him think. - Okay. I'm gonna
need everything you got on this.

703
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:27,109
All the work you've been doing on
gravimetric anomalies, everything.

704
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:29,566
Okay.
- Are you well, Eric?

705
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:34,910
Your brother is not coming, is he?
- Loki is dead.

706
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:37,510
Thank God.

707
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:40,550
I... I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

708
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:07,270
Forgive me, my liege.

709
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:11,030
I've returned from the
Dark World with news.

710
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:16,350
Thor?
- There's no sign of Thor,

711
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:19,470
nor the weapon, but...

712
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:22,390
What?

713
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:27,030
We've found the body.

714
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:32,670
Loki.

715
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:40,110
Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a
spot where all the 9 worlds are connected.

716
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:44,390
Amplifying the weapon's impact.
With each additional world,

717
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:46,550
the power will increase exponentially,

718
01:24:46,585 --> 01:24:49,309
effect would be universal.

719
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:51,326
Yes, but the alignment
is only temporary.

720
01:24:51,327 --> 01:24:53,391
He must be exactly at the
right place at the right time.

721
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:59,310
Well, how do we know where it is?
- We follow the directions.

722
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:04,390
This had happened before, thousands of
years ago. The Ancient were there to see it.

723
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:10,190
All the great constructions:
Mayas, the Chinese, the Egyptians,

724
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:13,550
they've used gravitational
effects of the Convergence.

725
01:25:13,585 --> 01:25:15,385
They left us a map.

726
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:18,110
Stonehenge...

727
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:20,590
Snowdon, Great Orme.

728
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:22,830
These are all coordinates taking us...

729
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:26,590
here.

730
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:31,270
Greenwich. - The walls between
worlds will be almost nonexistent.

731
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,109
Physics is gonna go ballistic.

732
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:36,710
Increase and decrease in gravity,
spatial extrusions.

733
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:38,630
The very fabric of
reality is gonna be torn apart.

734
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:44,950
Better to get my pants.

735
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:50,030
Focus, this is important.
We'll hammer them in all over the site

736
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:51,870
and Jane and Eric will activate
them from the top of the tower.

737
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:53,669
They're taped together.

738
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:56,510
Do you even know what these things do?

739
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:59,550
No.
- Neither do I.

740
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:10,590
Come on, come on!
- Fine!

741
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,790
Holy shit!

742
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:46,085
You need not to come
so far, Asgardian!

743
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,445
Death will to come
to you soon enough.

744
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:53,325
Not by your hand!

745
01:27:53,405 --> 01:27:58,205
Your world and your family
will be extinguished.

746
01:28:00,765 --> 01:28:03,325
We're running out of time.
- Almost there.

747
01:28:03,431 --> 01:28:05,971
Are you sure this is going to work?
These devices were made to detect anomalies,

748
01:28:06,311 --> 01:28:08,791
not causing them.
- Come on.

749
01:28:14,391 --> 01:28:16,551
Come on, Darcy.

750
01:28:26,471 --> 01:28:30,951
You know with all that power,
I thought you would hit harder.

751
01:28:55,591 --> 01:28:58,111
Done.

752
01:29:04,151 --> 01:29:06,196
The Convergence will be in
full effect in 7 minutes.

753
01:29:06,231 --> 01:29:08,591
That just means we'll have to
keep Malekith busy for eight.

754
01:29:15,591 --> 01:29:18,551
Okay. You might wanna
hold on to something.

755
01:29:23,151 --> 01:29:25,991
That is awesome.
How did you do that?

756
01:29:26,151 --> 01:29:30,031
Well, gravitational fields interact
with weak spots between worlds

757
01:29:30,111 --> 01:29:32,351
creating...
- Oh, there's a guy with a sword!

758
01:29:35,711 --> 01:29:37,511
Oops.
- Let's go.

759
01:29:38,231 --> 01:29:40,551
What the hell just happened?

760
01:29:41,511 --> 01:29:44,031
Move!

761
01:29:59,991 --> 01:30:02,791
What are you all doing?
You need to get out of here! Now!

762
01:30:03,151 --> 01:30:04,790
You're joking, right?

763
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:07,871
That's Thor out there waving
his hammer around on everything.

764
01:31:26,191 --> 01:31:29,551
Confirm the ship is hostile?
- Confirm, the ship is hostile.

765
01:31:29,591 --> 01:31:33,711
You have permission to engage.
- Roger. The missiles locked.

766
01:31:34,311 --> 01:31:36,831
The missile's on its way.

767
01:31:37,311 --> 01:31:40,951
Missile off target! I repeat!

768
01:31:41,111 --> 01:31:44,071
I'm losing control.
Mayday! Mayday!

769
01:31:46,351 --> 01:31:49,191
What are you doing?
- My signal is not connected.

770
01:31:51,471 --> 01:31:53,991
Jane! Come on!

771
01:32:35,511 --> 01:32:38,191
Are you alright?
- You saved my life.

772
01:32:41,911 --> 01:32:43,871
Yeah. Yes, I did.

773
01:32:53,351 --> 01:32:55,791
Darcy?
- Jane!

774
01:32:55,951 --> 01:32:58,351
Ian?
- Selvig?

775
01:32:58,511 --> 01:33:01,031
Mjolnir!

776
01:33:07,311 --> 01:33:12,351
How do I get to Greenwich?
- Take this train, three stops.

777
01:33:17,671 --> 01:33:20,191
Sorry. Sorry.

778
01:33:57,391 --> 01:34:00,991
We're out of time.
- Jane. Jane!

779
01:34:27,151 --> 01:34:28,951
Thor!

780
01:34:29,591 --> 01:34:31,391
You're too late.

781
01:34:32,031 --> 01:34:34,271
The Convergence is on its peak.

782
01:34:35,365 --> 01:34:37,725
Those things will stop him?
- Not from here?

783
01:34:37,765 --> 01:34:40,885
We can't get close enough.

784
01:34:41,965 --> 01:34:44,485
I can.

785
01:35:08,445 --> 01:35:10,325
Malekith!

786
01:35:16,925 --> 01:35:19,965
The darkness returns, Asgardian.

787
01:35:20,085 --> 01:35:23,255
Have you come to witness
the end of your universe?

788
01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:25,885
I've come to accept your surrender.

789
01:35:45,165 --> 01:35:50,125
You think you can stop me?
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

790
01:35:50,685 --> 01:35:53,205
But you can.

791
01:36:38,365 --> 01:36:40,165
Thor! No!

792
01:36:50,205 --> 01:36:52,725
Jane!

793
01:37:21,845 --> 01:37:23,925
Everybody okay?

794
01:38:08,045 --> 01:38:09,845
He's gonna come back.

795
01:38:12,245 --> 01:38:16,831
Except, you know, last time
he was gone for like two years.

796
01:38:17,005 --> 01:38:19,045
It's only been two days.

797
01:38:20,154 --> 01:38:21,913
Did he say anything before he left?

798
01:38:21,914 --> 01:38:24,274
Yeah, he had to figure some
stuff out with his father.

799
01:38:24,754 --> 01:38:27,994
He kinda committed treason... on a way out.

800
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:41,394
You once said there would
never be wiser king than me.

801
01:38:42,274 --> 01:38:46,674
You were wrong. The alignment has
brought all the realms together.

802
01:38:47,634 --> 01:38:51,634
Every one of them saw you
offer your life to save them.

803
01:38:51,794 --> 01:38:55,530
What can Asgard offer
its new King in return?

804
01:38:56,954 --> 01:38:58,754
My life.

805
01:38:59,834 --> 01:39:01,914
Father, I cannot be King of Asgard.

806
01:39:02,754 --> 01:39:07,514
I will protect Asgard and all the
realms with my last and every breath,

807
01:39:07,674 --> 01:39:09,474
but I cannot do so from that chair.

808
01:39:09,914 --> 01:39:11,919
Loki for all his grave imbalance

809
01:39:11,954 --> 01:39:14,554
understood rule as
I know and I never will.

810
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:18,794
The brutality, the sacrifice
It changes you.

811
01:39:19,554 --> 01:39:22,434
Id rather be a good
man than a great King.

812
01:39:23,514 --> 01:39:27,994
Is this my son I hear?
Or the woman he loves?

813
01:39:28,034 --> 01:39:30,074
When you speak I never hear Mothers voice.

814
01:39:32,834 --> 01:39:37,674
This is not for Jane, Father. She
does not know what I came here to say.

815
01:39:38,114 --> 01:39:41,394
Now forbid me to see her or
say she can rule at my side,

816
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:45,994
it changes nothing.
- One son who wanted the Throne too much,

817
01:39:47,514 --> 01:39:49,754
another who will not take it.

818
01:39:50,354 --> 01:39:53,394
Is this my legacy?
- Loki died with honor.

819
01:39:54,674 --> 01:39:57,474
I shall try to live the same.
Is that not legacy enough?

820
01:40:07,914 --> 01:40:12,874
It belongs to you.
If you are worthy of it.

821
01:40:13,634 --> 01:40:15,434
I shall try to be.

822
01:40:17,354 --> 01:40:22,394
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

823
01:40:22,914 --> 01:40:24,754
I know.

824
01:40:27,394 --> 01:40:30,514
If I were proud of the
man my son had become,

825
01:40:31,394 --> 01:40:33,234
even that I could not say,

826
01:40:36,714 --> 01:40:38,874
I would speak only from my heart:

827
01:40:41,234 --> 01:40:45,114
Go, my son.

828
01:40:47,154 --> 01:40:50,194
Thank you father.

829
01:41:04,676 --> 01:41:06,556
No.

830
01:41:06,876 --> 01:41:08,956
Thank you.

831
